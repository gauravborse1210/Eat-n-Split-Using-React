# Eat-n-Split

This is a React app that helps you manage shared expenses between friends. You can add new friends with custom avatars, select one from the list, and split bills based on who paid and how much. The app updates each friend's balance and shows whether you owe them, they owe you, or you're even. It uses React hooks for state management and has a clean, responsive UI styled with CSS grid and custom variables.
